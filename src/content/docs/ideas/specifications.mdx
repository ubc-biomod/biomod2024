## Our Criteria for Success

### DNA Origami Box Design

- [x] Box is thermodynamically stable
- [x] Box design is capable of docking anti-CD3 antibody
- [x] Box has a viable lock and key mechanism
- [x] Anti-CD3 antibody successfully attaches inside of box

### Evaluation of Target Specificity to Prostate Cancer Cells

- [x] Anti-CD3 antibody binds to T cells
- [x] Box + anti-CD3 antibody binds to T cells
- [x] Design RNA aptamer that binds to PSMA receptor (aptamer 1)
- [x] Box + aptamer 1 binds to PSMA receptor

### Validation of Function Upon Binding to Prostate Cancer Cells

- [ ] T cells are recruited by box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamer
- [ ] T cells are activated by box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamer
- [ ] Box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamer 1 opens upon binding to PSMA receptor
- [ ] Box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamers 1 and 2 opens upon binding to both PSMA and NTSR1 receptors
- [ ] In vitro testing using LNCaP cells

## Objectives

The objectives for this project are as follows:

<Steps>

1. Designing and synthesizing an appropriate DNA Origami Box via DNA/RNA nanostructure tools, and validating the formation of our DNA origami box using gel electrophoresis and TEM

1. Attaching the anti-CD3 antibody to the box via antibody docking, and validating the attachment of the anti-CD3 antibody by gel electrophoresis and TEM

1. Verifying that our chosen aptamer binds to PSMA with ELISA

1. Confirming that our chosen anti-CD3 antibody binds to T-cells using flow cytometry

1. Verifying that the box will bind to prostate cancer cells and open via flow cytometry

1. Checking for T-cell activation and recruitment to treat prostate cancer by flow cytometry and a transwell migration assay
