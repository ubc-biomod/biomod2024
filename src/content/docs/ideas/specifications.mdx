## Our Criteria for Success
### DNA Origami Box Design
   - [X] Box is thermodynamically stable 
   - [X] Box design is capable of docking anti-CD3 antibody
   - [X] Box has a viable lock and key mechanism
   - [X] Anti-CD3 antibody successfully attaches inside of box

### Evaluation of Target Specificity to Prostate Cancer Cells 
   - [X] Anti-CD3 antibody binds to T cells
   - [X] Box + anti-CD3 antibody binds to T cells
   - [X] Design RNA aptamer that binds to PSMA receptor (aptamer 1)
   - [X] Box + aptamer 1 binds to PSMA receptor
   - [X] Design RNA aptamer that binds to NTSR1 receptor (aptamer 2)
   - [X] Box + aptamers 1 and 2 bind to PSMA and NTSR1 receptor

### Validation of Function Upon Binding to Prostate Cancer Cells
   - [X] T cells are recruited by box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamer
   - [X] T cells are activated by box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamer
   - [X] Box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamer 1 opens upon binding to PSMA receptor
   - [X] Box + anti-CD3 antibody + aptamers 1 and 2 opens upon binding to both PSMA and NTSR1 receptors
   - [X] In vitro testing using LNCaP cells

## Objectives
The objectives for this project are as follows:
<Steps>
1. Designing and synthesizing an appropriate DNA Origami Box via DNA/RNA nanostructure tools, and validating the formation of our DNA origami box using gel electrophoresis and TEM

1. Attaching the anti-CD3 antibody to the box via antibody docking, and validating the attachment of the anti-CD3 antibody by gel electrophoresis and TEM

1. Verifying that our chosen aptamer binds to PSMA with ELISA

1. Confirming that our chosen anti-CD3 antibody binds to T-cells using flow cytometry

1. Verifying that the box will bind to prostate cancer cells and open via flow cytometry

1. Checking for T-cell activation and recruitment to treat prostate cancer by flow cytometry and a transwell migration assay
